## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox and use the best configurations for bring the challenge solution to the reality.

```css
.qr-code-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-around;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Usign HTML5 semantics, I was able to implement each tag for their proper use.

```html
<section class="qr-code-container"></section>

<img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" class="qr-code-img" alt="" />
```
